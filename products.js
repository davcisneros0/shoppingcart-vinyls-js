        description: "Chicago native Jefferson was working at a post office when he produced one of the first great vocal house records, nailing the combination of hummable melody and headlong momentum that has pulled wallflowers onto the dance floor for 35 years. “The reason I wanted to have a funky piano in ‘Move Your Body’ was because of Elton John,” Jefferson explained. But since he wasn’t a skilled piano player, he recorded the part at the manageable tempo of 40 beats per minute, and then sped it up to the canonical house tempo of 120 bpm. Jefferson recruited a friend and fellow postal worker, Curtis McClain, to sing vocals. - House - 125 BPM",

Teaming up with vocalist Mz Burn, 'En La Selva' is a production that exemplifies his low-slung and heady sound, featuring murky bass tones, crisp rolling drums, and bumping bass hits that work in harmony with the hooky vocals and spiralling synths",
